The following key steps are done:

1. Importing Libraries: Essential Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `sklearn` are imported for data handling and model building.

2. Importing CSV File: The dataset is loaded from a file named `mail_data.csv`, which likely contains emails labeled as spam or not.

3. Data Pre-processing: The data is checked for null values, duplicates are removed, and the email categories (spam or ham) are encoded into binary values (0 and 1).

4. Feature Extraction: The email messages are processed to extract features that will be used for classification.

5. Training and Testing: The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

6. Selection of Classification Algorithm: Various algorithms may have been tested to classify the emails as spam or ham.

7. Model Evaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy scores.

8. Prediction: The model is used to predict whether new emails are spam or not.
